# Module: `ami`

Looks up the most recent Packer-built k8s base AMI (see `/packer` at the
repo root) and outputs its ID. One AMI is shared by both the master node
(`modules/ec2`) and the worker Auto Scaling Group (`modules/asg`) — same
pattern as the single AL2023 AMI they both resolved before this change,
except now it's a custom image with containerd/kubeadm/kubelet/kubectl and
node prep baked in via Ansible instead of installed at every boot.
