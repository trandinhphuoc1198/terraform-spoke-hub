# Shared Transit Gateway connecting the hub cluster's VPC to every spoke
# cluster's VPC. This lives in its own state because it's a shared resource
# that neither hub nor spoke should be able to destroy/recreate as a side
# effect of an unrelated change in their own root module.
#
# Apply this FIRST, before live/hub or live/spoke — both of those read its
# transit_gateway_id via a terraform_remote_state data source.
