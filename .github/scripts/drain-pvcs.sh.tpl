# Deletes every namespace that currently owns a PersistentVolumeClaim, then
# waits for those PVCs to fully disappear.
#
# WHY NAMESPACE DELETE, NOT `kubectl delete pvc`:
#   A PVC carries the kubernetes.io/pvc-protection finalizer, which only
#   clears once no Pod is still using it. kube-prometheus-stack's
#   Prometheus/Grafana and Tempo's ingester are StatefulSets/Deployments —
#   their pods are still running at this point, so `kubectl delete pvc`
#   alone just leaves it stuck in Terminating forever: the pod never gets
#   torn down, the volume attachment never releases, the finalizer never
#   clears, and the aws-ebs-csi-driver never reaches the point of calling
#   DeleteVolume on the real AWS resource.
#
#   Deleting the whole namespace cascades pod termination first, which
#   releases the volume attachment, which lets the finalizer chain run to
#   completion: PVC finalizer clears -> PV finalizer clears -> CSI driver
#   issues DeleteVolume. This only works because platform/values/spoke/
#   ebs-csi.yaml sets reclaimPolicy: Delete on the ebs-csi StorageClass.
#
# CAVEAT — ArgoCD self-heal race:
#   If this spoke/hub is still registered with ArgoCD and its Applications
#   have selfHeal: true, ArgoCD *could* try to recreate a deleted namespace
#   mid-drain. It can't successfully create resources into a Terminating
#   namespace, so this mostly just delays things rather than corrupting the
#   drain — but if you want to eliminate the race entirely, deregister the
#   cluster from ArgoCD (delete argocd/clusters/<name>.yaml + the cluster
#   Secret) BEFORE running this, so ArgoCD prunes everything itself first.
#
# Always exits 0 — a stuck PVC should not block terraform destroy from
# proceeding. The caller (GitHub Actions step) surfaces the warning.
